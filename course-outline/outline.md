- Angular apps are a **composition** of components.
- Data is passed down to components using **Inputs**.
- Events are fired from components as **Outputs**.

- Angular use RxJS: Reactive extensions to Javascript. This programming paradigm uses Observables: objects which manage an async stream of data.
