    { h : "Angular React" , t : "John Coumbe,  June 1 2019" },
    { h : "Framework" , t: "A framework provides a standard agreed way for a team to build a project in a structured way."},
    { h : "Today" , t : "Today's course will introduce <span>Angular</span> and <span>React</span> using hands-on exercises." },
    { h : "Do I need a framework?" , t : "Plain Javascript works for small, new projects developed by <span>one experienced Javascript developer</span> with an understanding of scope and how to structure code." },
    { h : "Javascript" , t : "Douglas Crockford: 'A beautiful, elegant, highly expressive language that is buried under a steaming pile of good intentions and blunders.'" },
    { h : "Javascript" , t : "Javascript was created in 10 days in 1995 by one man, Brendan Eich. A simple looking syntax with complex scope ideas." },
    { h : "Teams" , t : "We need ways to write code in teams. <span>Collaboration</span> is easier with shared conventions and ready-made scaffolding."},
    { h : "Complexity" , i : "media/Högertrafikomläggningen.jpg" },
    { h : "Complexity" , t : 'Derek Bailey: "Without components our applications become monolithic spaghetti monsters."' },
    { h : "Components" , t : "Components are a fundamental building block of both Angular and React." },
    { h : "Components" , t : "A component combines markup, logic, state, and style to create a reusable custom element." },
    { h : "Components" , t : "React and Angular application are a hierarchy of components. A component contains instances of other components." },
    { h : "Components" , t : "Components combine markup (HTML) and logic (JS) in the same file, challenging traditional approaches to web development." },
    { h : "Composition" , t : "<span>The secret to building large things?</span> Make small things and compose/combine them together intelligently."},
    { h : "Proven on big projects" , t : "React is used in Instagram and AirBnB. Angular is used in Paypal and Netflix."},
    { h : "State" , t : "The programmer manages changes of state. The framework updates the view to reflect state changes."},
    { h : "Scope" , t : "Scope in Javascript is complex. Javascript frameworks help but they do not make scope problems disappear."},
    { h : "Javascript ES6" , t : "An understanding of ES6 is essential for working with React and Angular: <span>Arrow functions, classes, let, const, destructuring, modules, template-strings</span>"},
    { h : "Functional programming" , t : "Use <span>pure</span> functions to transform data: map, filter, reduce, sort, forEach."},
    { h : "Typescript" , t : "A <span>compile-time</span> technology not a run-time. Spot errors in the editor, and describe your intentions more clearly in code."}, 
    { h : "Juggling languages" , t : "ES5, ES6, HTML, CSS, Typescript, JSX, Node"},
    { h : "Transpilers" , t : "Your Angular or React source is transpiled back to ES5 JS to run on older browsers using tools such as Webpack and Babel."},
    { h : "Angular" , t : "Batteries included: provides everything out of the box including a router, HTTP services, forms, testing."},
    { h : "Angular" , t : "Uses reactive programming techniques (RsJx) including Observables."},     
    { h : "React" , t : "A more minimal approach. The library does not provide everything built-in."},
    { h : "React" , t : "Uses an HTML-like syntax called JSX for combining markup and logic." },
    { h : "Feeling overwhelmed?" , i : "media/monkey.gif" }
