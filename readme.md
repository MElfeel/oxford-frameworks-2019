## Oxford React Angular Frameworks 2018

## Slide ideas

- Observables are just one pattern out of many that you can use with Angular.
- Promises emit a single value whereas streams emit many values. Streams improve upon the promise pattern in that we can continuously respond to data changes on a stream (vs. a one-time resolve from a promise)
